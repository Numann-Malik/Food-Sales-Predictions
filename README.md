## Objectives

- We help the retailer understand the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in increasing sales.
- We completed statistical analyses that might help us understand, explain, or model with our data. This includes a Histogram to view the distributions of various features in our dataset, aBoxplot to view statistical summaries of various features in our dataset, and a Heatmap of the correlation between features.
- By using machine learning, we help the retailer to make predictions about future sales based on the data provided.
- Finally, we built a linear regression model and a simple regression tree model on our data set. These are to help the retailer understand the properties of products and outlets that play crucial roles in predicting sales.
